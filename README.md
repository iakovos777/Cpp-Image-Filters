# Cpp-Image-Filters
Image processing and filtering for images in PPM format implemented in C++. The filters that were implemented in the project were: 
Linear Filter, 
Gamma Filter. 
The filters could be applied one by one or stacked and the program would generate the final output and save the filtered image to disk.
